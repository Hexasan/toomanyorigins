## TooManyOrigins v1.0.0
### Origins
**General**
- Reworked every origin. If you would like to have the old origins, you are able to use the legacy content built-in datapack.
- Reworded many descriptions to open up more player interpretation.

**Datapacking**
- Added built-in Legacy TooManyOrigins datapack.
- Added `legacy_content.json` file found in the datapack directory `data/toomanyorigins/legacy_content.json`, this is able to enable any legacy content that the pack may need by setting a value in the json file to `true`. This can enable `dragon_fireball`, `withered_crops` and `zombifying`.
- Clients will have legacy content synced upon joining a server.
